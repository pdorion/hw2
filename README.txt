This is my week 2 homework for KIEI 451 Spring 2021 with Ben Block. It is a website for a fictional law firm with three pages- a home page and two linked pages on locations and the "team". It has been modified with the Tailwind CSS framework and has a form that sends a query to google maps. - Patrick Dorion
